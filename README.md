## üìÇ File Structure

The application is organized into a multi-page structure, separating the core logic from the user interface.

-   `logic.py`: **(Backend)** Contains all data processing, financial calculations, and machine learning functions. It does not interact with the Streamlit frontend directly.
-   `main_1.py`: **(Frontend - Entrypoint)** The main script that serves as the landing page. It handles file uploads and user input for income and savings goals. It is recommended to rename this file to `app.py`.
-   `pages/dashboard.py`: **(Frontend - Navigation)** Acts as a central hub, presenting analysis options to the user and navigating them to the appropriate view.
-   `pages/analysis.py`: **(Frontend - Display)** A dynamic page that renders different charts and data tables based on the user's selection in the dashboard.
